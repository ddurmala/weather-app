## Description

This weather dashboard allows users to type in a city name and see both the current forecast for that city as well as the 5 day forecast.  The current weather displays the city name, the current date, an icon representing the current weather, temperature, humidity and windspeed.

The 5 day forecast displays the day of the week along with the month and date. It also displays an icon, temperature, humidity & wind speed. 

after searching a city, the city name populates in the search history.  Users can then click on the city name to re-populate it in the input where it can be used to recall weather data for that city.
